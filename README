If you don't have cmake installed then compile by issuing the following command:
	g++ -o pimg processImage.cpp -O3 -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lm -lpthread -lX11 -DGCC_COMPILATION

else:
	for building out of source:
	In Release mode:
		mkdir -p build/release
		cd build/release
		cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../../
		make
	
	In Debug mode:
		mkdir -p build/debug
		cd build/debug
		cmake ../../
		make

For using Xcode:
	cmake -GXcode ../../

but have to test if it works with Xcode just like that.


To run the cuda code:
	nvcc -o gpuimg gpuProcessImage.cu -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lm -lpthread -lX11
